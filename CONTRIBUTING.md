# Contributing to API Sentinel

First off, thank you for considering contributing to API Sentinel! We welcome any help, whether it's reporting a bug, proposing a new feature, or writing code. Every contribution is valuable to us.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How to Contribute

We encourage contributions in various forms. Here’s how you can help:

### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please help us by reporting it. Before creating a new issue:
1. **Check existing issues**: Make sure the bug hasn't already been reported.
2. **Gather information**: Collect details about the bug, including:
    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - What you expected to happen.
    - What actually happened (including error messages, logs, or screenshots if applicable).
    - Your environment (e.g., browser version, OS, API Sentinel version if known).
3. **Create a new issue**: If the bug is new, create an issue using the "Bug Report" template if available, or provide the information gathered above.

### Suggesting Enhancements
We are always looking for ideas to improve API Sentinel. If you have a suggestion:
1. **Check existing issues/ideas**: See if your enhancement has already been suggested.
2. **Formulate your idea**: Clearly describe the proposed feature, why it would be beneficial, and any potential use cases.
3. **Create a new issue**: If your idea is new, create an issue using the "Feature Request" template if available, or provide a clear and detailed description.

### Your First Code Contribution
Ready to contribute code? Here’s how to get started:
1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the GitHub repository page.
2. **Clone your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/API-Sentinel.git`
3. **Create a new branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/your-bug-fix-name`. Choose a descriptive branch name.
4. **Make your changes**: Write your code, ensuring you follow the project's coding style (see "Coding Standards" below).
5. **Test your changes**: Add or update tests if applicable and ensure all tests pass.
6. **Commit your changes**: Write clear, concise commit messages. Reference any related issue numbers (e.g., `git commit -m "Fix: Resolve issue #123 by doing X"`).

### Pull Request Process
Once your changes are ready:
1. **Push your branch**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original API Sentinel repository and click "New pull request".
    - Ensure the base branch is the main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
    - The compare branch should be your feature/bugfix branch.
3. **Fill out the PR template**:
    - **Reference the issue**: Link to the issue your PR addresses (e.g., "Closes #123").
    - **Clear description**: Explain the changes you've made and why.
    - **Tests**: Mention if you've added or updated tests.
4. **Code Review**: Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers. Be prepared to address feedback and make further changes if requested.
5. **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be merged!

## Coding Standards
- **Follow existing style**: For now, please try to match the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase.
- **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
- **Go specific**: If contributing to the backend, run `go fmt` and `go vet` on your changes.

## Setting up your Development Environment
Please refer to the "Getting Started" section in the [README.md](README.md) for instructions on how to set up your development environment for both the frontend and backend.

## Issue Management Guide

### How to Create a Good Issue
- **Clear Title**: Use a concise and descriptive title that summarizes the issue.
- **Detailed Description**: Provide as much relevant information as possible. For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, error messages, and environment details. For feature requests, explain the use case and benefits.
- **Labels**: If you have permission, apply relevant labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`). Maintainers will also help with this.

### How to Participate in Discussions on Issues
- **Be respectful**: Engage in discussions constructively and respectfully.
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on the issue at hand.
- **Provide context**: If you're adding new information or responding to a comment, provide enough context for others to understand.

## Code of Conduct
We expect all contributors and participants to adhere to a Code of Conduct to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.
*(Placeholder: We will adopt a standard Code of Conduct soon. In the meantime, please be respectful and considerate in all interactions.)*
