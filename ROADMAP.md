# API Sentinel Development Roadmap

## Introduction
This document outlines the development roadmap for API Sentinel. It provides insight into our future plans and priorities. Please note that this roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and evolving project needs.

## Current Status
API Sentinel has successfully implemented its core functionalities, providing a solid foundation for API security monitoring and health checks. Key features include:
- Real-time security score tracking.
- Vulnerability trend analysis.
- Post-quantum cryptography readiness assessment.
- API health and performance monitoring.
- Basic analytics and reporting.
- JWT-based authentication and rate limiting.
- A static informational website with API documentation.

## Planned Features (Short-Term)
Our immediate focus is on enhancing user experience, security, and integration capabilities.
- **Enhanced Alerting Mechanisms**:
    - Integration with email notifications for critical alerts.
    - Support for Slack and other popular messaging platforms for real-time alerts.
- **User and Role Management**:
    - Implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    - Ability for administrators to manage users and assign roles/permissions.
- **Improved API Onboarding**:
    - Streamlined process for registering and configuring new APIs for monitoring.
- **Detailed Security Scan Reports**:
    - Generation of downloadable PDF reports for security scans.

## Planned Features (Mid-Term)
Looking further ahead, we aim to broaden the scope and intelligence of API Sentinel.
- **Deeper CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:
    - Plugins or webhooks to integrate API Sentinel scans directly into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
    - Automated feedback on API security during the development lifecycle.
- **Support for More API Protocols**:
    - Extend monitoring capabilities beyond REST to include gRPC and GraphQL APIs.
- **Advanced Vulnerability Management**:
    - Tracking the lifecycle of identified vulnerabilities (e.g., open, acknowledged, resolved).
    - Integration with external vulnerability databases.
- **Historical Data Archival & Analysis**:
    - Options for long-term storage and more sophisticated trend analysis of metrics.

## Planned Features (Long-Term)
Our long-term vision is to make API Sentinel a proactive and highly intelligent API security platform.
- **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**:
    - Machine learning models to detect unusual patterns or anomalies in API traffic that might indicate an attack or misuse.
    - Predictive analytics for potential security threats.
- **Customizable Reporting Engine**:
    - Allow users to build and schedule custom reports based on various metrics and filters.
    - Export reports in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, etc.).
- **Automated Remediation Suggestions**:
    - Provide actionable suggestions or automated workflows for addressing common vulnerabilities.
- **Expanded Compliance Automation**:
    - Support for a wider range of compliance standards and automated evidence gathering.

## UI/UX Enhancements
We are committed to continuously improving the user interface and experience of API Sentinel.
- **General Improvements**: Ongoing efforts to refine workflows, improve clarity, and ensure ease of use.
- **Theme Customization**:
    - Options for users to choose between light/dark themes or customize theme colors.
- **Improved Data Visualization & Dashboard Interactivity**:
    - More advanced charting options and interactive dashboards.
    - Ability for users to create custom dashboards.
- **Enhanced Mobile Responsiveness**:
    - Further improvements to ensure the web interface is fully functional and user-friendly on mobile and tablet devices.
